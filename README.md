# Monty Hall Game in Rust

This small project implements the classic **Monty Hall** problem. The main goal is to teach the logic behind the game while practicing and learning basic Rust fundamentals.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need Rust installed on your system. You can easily install Rust using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/):

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

After installation, verify that `rustc` and `cargo` are available by running:

```bash
rustc --version
cargo --version
```

## How to run

1. Clone the repository or download the code.
2. Navigate to the project root folder in your terminal.
3. Run the project using:

```bash
cargo run
```

This will compile and run the Monty Hall game.

Have fun playing and learning Rust! ðŸŽ²
